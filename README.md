#LAZYbot

Discord bot operating in [the House server](http://dscrd.me/housechessvariants), servicing just over 1,100 members [December 2018].
Has helped LAZY's understanding of basic js.
Written in Node.JS.
Currently (due to lack of confidence in the bot's database system and concerns over pricing for hosting) not available on multiple servers. If/when the bot is switched over to a (cheaper) linux server, and the database system is revamped, an add-server link will be added.

This bot has also spawned off [LAZYmail](https://github.com/theLAZYmd/LAZYmail), a version of the bot with just the below-mentioned ModMail module. This is in use in the official [IBO Discord server](https://discord.gg/IBO) and services over 10,000 members [December 2018]. 

###Hosting
- **Provider:** Amazon EC2 Instance
- **Region:** eu-west-2a
- **Instance Type:** t2.small
- **OS:** Windows (for now)
- **Running Cost:** Â£0.28 [November 2018]

###Highlights
- [Election module](https://github.com/theLAZYmd/LAZYbot/tree/master/src/modules/Election/) - runs a fully-automated election system on Discord with no third-party libs that, in order:
  - Allow choosing of customisable settings, such as date, voting system, scope of election, electorate list, various rules such as whether to find and exclude dupe accounts, where to set a minimum threshold on messages, on sponsors required for nominations, on number of elections able to run for (if holding several at the several time), and who the voters are.
  - Allows a 'sponsoring' system to nominate candidates
  - Registers candidates, registers votes (based on members in Discord server)
  - Sends round customisable ballots
  - Receives votes through DM channels (for secret ballots), parses the information, and stores them
  - Counts them and parses results
  - Outputs winners using an 'emoji react' system - when a sufficient number of emojis are pressed, results are revealed
- [Profile module](https://github.com/theLAZYmd/LAZYbot/blob/master/src/modules/Profile/profile.js) - creates a 'profile' for each Discord user with:
  - Basic administratory information (user ID, date joined and the like from Discord API)
  - Integration with the lichess and chess.com API to support account linking
  - Customisable finger notes
  - Count messages sent in the server

- [Permissions system](https://github.com/theLAZYmd/LAZYbot/blob/master/src/util/permissions.js) that allows limitations on certain commands to who can use them

  - Parses other personal information (like name, country) and makes it available through `!profile`
  - Compares that data in the database with that of other users, for comparison in [leaderboards](https://github.com/theLAZYmd/LAZYbot/blob/master/src/modules/Chess/leaderboard.js) through the command `!lb`

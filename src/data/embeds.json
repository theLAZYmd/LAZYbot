                "description": "\n__**ABOUT**__\n\n#zh\n\n**Crazyhouse** (ZH) is a chess variant in which an opponent's captured pieces can be dropped back on the board instead of moving a piece. Crazyhouse is a variant similar to bughouse chess, but with only two players.\n\nOther names for this variant are drop chess, mad chess, reinforcement chess, turnabout chess and schizo-chess. It’s also known as wild 23. \n\n__**RULES**__\n\nAll the rules and conventions of standard chess apply, with the addition of drops, as explained below.\n\n • A captured piece reverses colour and goes to the capturing player's pocket. At any time, instead of making a move with a piece on the board, a player can drop a piece from their pocket onto an empty square on the board.\n• Drops resulting in immediate checkmate are permitted.\n• Pawns may not be dropped on the players' 1st or 8th ranks.\n• Promoted but captured pawns are dropped as pawns.\n\nRules-page on lichess with video: https://lichess.org/variant/crazyhouse\n\n__**WHERE?**__\n\n● [lichess.org](https://lichess.org)\n● [chess.com](https://chess.com)\n● [Free Internet Chess Server](http://www.freechess.org/)\n● [Internet Chess Club](https://www.chessclub.com/)",

                "description": "**__IMPROVE__**\n\nCrazyhouse is a fast-paced game that needs strong tactics and a good awareness of positional weaknesses. Unlike regular chess, draws are rare because new pieces keep being reintroduced to the board. Check out [crosky’s crazyhouse overview](http://bit.ly/2FfYYMX).\n\n• As GM Yasser Seirawan would say, **king safety** comes first and foremost. Ensure that your king's position is safe from attack; this does not necessarily imply castling – dropping pieces around your king can effectively guard it from serious threats.\n\n• **Develop** your pieces in the opening and **control key squares**, especially around your king.\n\n• Beware of **holes** in your position. A hole provides an opening for an opponent's piece which can lead to a strong attack. If pieces do enter, chase them away and secure your position. As helmsknight would say, “get out of my house!” Similarly, seek to exploit any holes your opponent leaves in their position.\n\n• Beware of **piece sacs** on [f2/f7](https://youtu.be/kZPSNF8XHQI) or [g2/g7](https://youtu.be/6Gh2n9kWdb8), especially if the opponent has many pieces in hand.\n\n• Often the best defence is **attack**, as any mating sequence threatened must be dealt; the majority of crazyhouse moves have an **attacking purpose**. As Vempele says, the best defence against @h3 might be @h6. Launch counter-attacks that are faster and cannot be ignored.\n\n• **Initiative** is more important than material. If a player has initiative they can drop their pieces in hand with check and threats and dominate the board. It’s important to utilise positional dominance because if the initiative runs out, the opponent can take back initiative with pieces in hand and reassert control.",

                "description": "**__MATERIAL__**\n\n• **Pawns** are more valuable than in regular chess, because they can be dropped anywhere on the board including the seventh rank. A minor pieces can be happily traded for 2 pawns in most situations. Unlike chess, **Doubled Pawns** are less of a weakness because pawn structures can be fixed with pawns in hand, and a doubled pawn can even be a strength because it controls squares of both colours. \n\n• **Knights** are wonderful attackers because their threats can’t be blocked [...].\n\n• **Bishops** are strong defenders as they cover diagonals going backwards as well as forwards. A Bishop on g2, for instance, is able to take on h3 and still cover g2. They can also be good attackers because they control channels of a single colour. Pawns and Bishops are known as **\"diags”** because they can penetrate an opponent position along diagonals of a single colour. If all your pawns are on light squares for example, you must take care to defend dark square weaknesses. For more on the importance of colour complexes, check out [mastertan’s visual guide](http://bit.ly/2FQmVZn).\n\n• **Rooks** are useful to defend and attack open files. Dropping a rook on the back rank with check is a good way to force an opponent to “waste” a piece; combined with a pawn drop on the 7th exploiting the pin, this combination can have lethal effect. Rooks are often sacked on the backrank promoting a pawn to remove defenders. [Example](https://lichess.org/yUwqzUBO/black#27).\n\n• **Queens** are worth less in crazyhouse than in normal chess, because they can be hit with a tempo by minors, especially when dropped. Crazyhouse favors numeracy in pieces; a Bishop and Knight in hand have more versatility than a Queen. In general, Queens are worth about 2 minors.",

                "description": "**__STRATEGY__**\n\n• Crazyhouse is still chess, so **common chess tactics** still apply: try not to hang pieces or block in your own pieces; trap opponent pieces and use forks, pins and discovered checks. Because pieces can land anywhere on the board, one must be even more alert.\n\n• **Defending**. Under heavy attack, it is important to evaluate your position. You usually have three options: **First**, you could take your opponent’s attackers, try to stay safe and hope the attack exhausts itself and they run out of material. You might try to limit the flow of exchanges to give time to get the king safe and not give pieces that the opponent needs to mate you. **Second**, if a sacrifice is too dangerous to take, you could focus on defending, dropping pieces near your king to cover important squares. One could also make luft, giving the king a flight path, or a safe square it can fall back or run up to. **The third option** is to ignore the threat and start an attack of your own: if you are the one getting to the opponent’s king first, go for it! Going all in can also be a last resort hoping your opponent makes a mistake.\n\n• **Attacking**. To keep initiative, it is common for mating sequences to comprise purely of checks: [drawing the king out and/or cornering it](https://goo.gl/QLp4DY), [picking up pieces needed for mate](https://goo.gl/uNPKqG), [cutting off escape squares](https://goo.gl/2okT35), [luring the king to a mating square](https://goo.gl/Dd4BvF), [deflecting defending pieces](https://goo.gl/hX6Q85), and [opening up a file, diagonal or key square](https://goo.gl/AqLN86).\n\n• It is important to be familiar with [common mating patterns](https://goo.gl/7ejioW).",

The game is usually played at a fast time control; this, together with the passing and dropping of pieces, can make the game look chaotic and random to the casual onlooker; hence the name bughouse, which is slang for mental hospital.\n\nBughouse chess is often called as its abbreviation bug. Other names for this variant are exchange chess, siamese chess, tandem chess, transfer chess, double bughouse, cross chess, swap chess or simply bughouse. It’s also known as wild 24.\n\n__**RULES**__\n\nNormal chess rules apply on bughouse, except that captured pieces on one board are passed on to the teammate on the other board, who then has the option of putting these pieces on his or her board. On any given move, you can either make a normal move, or \"drop\" a piece. You can only drop pieces that you have in hand, from your partner's captures.\n\n__**WHERE?**__\n\nBughouse can be played on..\n\n● [Free Internet Chess Server](http://www.freechess.org/)\n● [bughousetest.com](http://bughousetest.com)\n● [chess.com](http://chess.com)\n\nCompiled by @MMichael#3973",

                "description": "__**BASIC MISTAKES **__\n\nAntichess is a very theoretical variant and there is lot of theory in it, especially cause of lines being often forced. Opening blunders are common between beginners, so safe openings such as **1. e3** are recommended. Losing openings for White include **1.a3, 1.b4, 1.c3, 1.d3, 1.d4, 1.e4, 1.f3, 1.f4, 1.h3, 1.h4, 1.Nc3** and **1.Nf3** but many of these are not trivial. Apart from 1. e3, other playable openings are **1.c4, 1.Nh3, 1.g3** (other openings are dubious). The most common novice mistakes are:\n\n• Trying to **give away all pieces immediately** is therefore a mistake. One should carefully consider piece position; having more pieces that the opponent gives the ability to 'control' you, then give away all the pieces in one initiative.\n\n• **Not developing.** Anti isn't really about giving away pieces in the beginning; one must develop pieces and make it harder for your opponent to move. That's a good strategy some of the really good players like to use, unless you have a forced win.\n\n• Giving away **important** pieces: it is important to know which pieces to keep and which to give. Bishops are often dangerous, so it is recommended for beginners to get rid of bishops as soon as possible. On the other hand, the king is a precious ally when an opponent tries to zugzwang, giving it away early is often a mistake. It's better to keep pieces instead of pawns, because pawns have a very limited range of moves and can be easily predicted or forced into zugzwang.\n\n• Being overly **passive**: simply trying to avoid exposing yourself to taking pieces lets an opponent 'control' you, then forcing you into zugzwang to take pieces. Carefully consider when one should trade and one should not.",

Sometimes, it is advantageous to use one piece to take a piece in the opponent's position while your opponent is taking pieces; this can be referred to as a [queen race](https://lichess.org/0vDXr9aX). Be careful about attempting this with other pieces after: [In this game](https://lichess.org/study/SqCNKpVW), Black is out of bishop moves and must take White's queen, resulting in a loss. [Another example](https://lichess.org/study/2EjMqvsp).\n\n• Be aware of so called quiet moves that can force your opponent **to take an unprotected piece**. [In this game](https://lichess.org/4FF1DBvW#4) an excellent example of such a move is 3. Bg2: preparing to take on b7, which will force Bxb7 and later Bxh1.\n\n• Do **not** be too eager to **push the h- and a-pawns** as this exposes the rooks in mid-game. Rooks can be easily controlled and this can lead to a disastrous position if your opponent forces your rook into their position and is able to give away lots of material for nothing. On the other hand, if the opponent doesn't have a **b/g-pawn** pushing the a/h-pawn is often [a good move](https://lichess.org/study/e7IRQR1f).",

Whenever a piece leaves its initial square, one of the extra pieces can be immediately be introduced to the vacant square. That means a player has eight opportunities to bring the Hawk and Elephant into play.

The starting position is [following](<https://i.imgur.com/sdnJ3Jz.png>).\n\nStandard chess rules apply, with the following restrictions:\n\n• It is not allowed to attack the opponent’s king. The concept of check is entirely forbidden.\n• The king is not allowed to move to a square which is attacked by an opponent’s piece (just like in standard chess).\n\nThe game is finished if one player moves their own king to the last rank.

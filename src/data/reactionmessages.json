Last time we had a qualification round with 64 players, then three knockout rounds (R64, R32 and R16), after which the eight Candidates remained. Those final eight players played a Candidates Tournament which led to the finals between **TwelveTeen** and **JannLee**. During three weeks, they played 60 thrilling games. After the dust settled, the final score was 31,5-28,5 in favor of **JannLee**, making him the first Crazyhouse World Champion. \n\nToday, it’s time to continue this story. Champions are not born; they are made in the quiet hours when nobody is watching. Sign-ups for the 2nd edition of the CWC start on February 1. Do you have what it takes to be the next champion?",

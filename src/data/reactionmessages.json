Last time we had a qualification round with 64 players, then three knockout rounds (R64, R32 and R16), after which the eight Candidates remained. Those final eight players played a Candidates Tournament which led to the finals between **TwelveTeen** and **JannLee**. During three weeks, they played 60 thrilling games. After the dust settled, the final score was 31,5-28,5 in favor of **JannLee**, making him the first Crazyhouse World Champion. \n\nToday, it’s time to continue this story. Champions are not born; they are made in the quiet hours when nobody is watching. Sign-ups for the 2nd edition of the CWC start on February 1. Do you have what it takes to be the next champion?",

The first player to reach 30.5 / 60 will be declared the winner. Please note the following stipulations:\n\n**1.** It is preferable if the games are rated. If **both** players agree then some or all games can be unrated.\n\n**2.** Results **and** games of each match should be messaged to the TD upon completion.\n\n**3.** All matches will consist of an equal number of White games per player.\n\n**4.** Each match will consist of ten (10) games of 3 + 2.\n\n**5.** Each player is entitled to a short break after every 2 games of approximately 10 minutes (these breaks can be accumulated).\n\n**6.** If somebody is unable to complete a series, or has to withdraw, their opponent is considered the victor. Only emergencies can exempt players from having this rule applied to them.\n\n**7.** Note that the final of the Crazyhouse World Championship will be played during three consecutive weeks – there will be no rest weeks.",
